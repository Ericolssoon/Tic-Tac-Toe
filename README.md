# Tic Tac Toe

This is my Tic Tac Toe game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku

In this game you can play against a friend you have in real life or any person you know.

[Here is the live version of my project](https://my-tic-tac-toe-gamee.herokuapp.com/)

## How to play

There are 3 rows, and each row has columns from 1-3.

You and your friend play as Player 'X' and Player '0'. 

Player 'X' starts the game by choosing which row and column.

The board will print out and player 'X' will see where he placed his marker.

The game goes on until there is a winner or when it end with a tie.

Have fun!
